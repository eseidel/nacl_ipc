/**
 * A resource is data associated with the Pepper plugin interface. While a
 * Var represents something callable to JS or from the plugin to the DOM, a
 * resource has no meaning or visibility outside of the plugin interface.
 *
 * Resources are reference counted. Use AddRefResource and ReleaseResource to
 * manage your reference count of a resource. The data will be automatically
 * destroyed when the internal reference count reaches 0.
 *
 * Value is an opaque handle assigned by the browser to the resource. It is
 * guaranteed never to be 0 for a valid resource, so a plugin can initialize
 * it to 0 to indicate a "NULL handle." Some interfaces may return a NULL
 * resource to indicate failure.
