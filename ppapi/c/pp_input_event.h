/**
 * An event representing a typed character.
 *
 * Normally, the program will receive a key down event, followed by a character
 * event, followed by a key up event. The character event will have any
 * modifier keys applied. Obvious examples are symbols, where Shift-5 gives you
 * a '%'. The key down and up events will give you the scan code for the "5"
 * key, and the character event will give you the '%' character.
 *
 * You may not get a character event for all key down if the key doesn't
 * generate a character. Likewise, you may actually get multiple character
 * events in a row. For example, some locales have an accent key that modifies
 * the next character typed. You might get this stream of events: accent down,
 * accent up (it didn't generate a character), letter key down, letter with
 * accent character event (it was modified by the previous accent key), letter
 * key up.  If the letter can't be combined with the accent, like an umlaut and
 * an 'R', the system might send unlaut down, umlaut up, 'R' key down, umlaut
 * character ("whoops, I can't combine it with 'R', I better just send the raw
 * unlaut so it isn't lost"), 'R' character event, 'R' key up.
