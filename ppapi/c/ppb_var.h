 * PPB_Var API

 * JavaScript specification:
 *
 * When referencing JS specification, we will refer to ECMAScript, 5th edition,
 * and we will put section numbers in square brackets.
 *
 * Exception handling:
 *
 * If an exception parameter is NULL, then any exceptions that happen during the
 * execution of the function will be ignored. If it is non-NULL, and has a type
 * of PP_VARTYPE_UNDEFINED, then if an exception is thrown it will be stored in
 * the exception variable. It it is non-NULL and not PP_VARTYPE_UNDEFINED, then
 * the function is a no-op, and, if it returns a value, it will return
 * PP_VARTYPE_UNDEFINED. This can be used to chain together multiple calls and
 * only check the exception at the end.
 *
 * Make sure not to intermix non-JS with JS calls when relying on this behavior
 * to catch JS exceptions, as non-JS functions will still execute!

 * JS engine's exceptions will always be of type PP_VARTYPE_OBJECT. However,
 * PP_Var interface can also throw PP_VARTYPE_STRING exceptions, in situations
 * where there's no JS execution context defined. These are usually invalid
 * parameter errors - passing an invalid PP_Var value, for example, will always
 * result in an PP_VARTYPE_STRING exception. Exceptions will not be of any other
 * type.
 * TODO(neb): Specify the exception for ill-formed PP_Vars, invalid module,
 * instance, resource, string and object ids.
